My research combines statistics and machine learning to develop robust, scalable systems for spatiotemporal processes. This work is primairly driven by problems in climate science.

## Research Areas

**Climate Model Evaluation and Integration**
My research develops statistical and machine learning methods for evaluating climate models against observations, with a focus on comparing long-run climate distributions and constraining future projections. As a counterpart to this work, I also work on deep learning / neural operator approaches that integrate physical model output with observational data to constrain climate projections and reduce bias.

**Uncertainty Quantification and Generative Modeling**
I am also working on conformal and distribution-free uncertainty quantification methods for neural operators more generally, with recent efforts connecting conformal inference to generative models that represent full predictive distributions. Ongoing research explores calibrated flow-based generative models as efficient alternatives to autoregressive climate emulators.

**Structure Discovery in Climate Systems**  
Finally, my group is also develops statistical and machine learning methods to uncover dependence structures, causal relationships, and compound risk in large-scale climate systems, enabling more reliable characterization of extremes and rare events.
