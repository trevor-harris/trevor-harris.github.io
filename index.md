# Trevor Harris

Assistant Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning

I work at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and climate science, with a focus on uncertainty quantification, operator learning, and climate model evaluation. My research develops rigorous and scalable statistical and machine learning methods for modeling complex spatiotemporal systems, with a primary focus on climate science. I study how to align large-scale physical climate models with observational data, quantify uncertainty in high-dimensional forecasts, and design principled tools for understanding climate risk.

## Key Research Areas

**Climate Model Evaluation and Integration**  
I develop statistical distances and operator-based methods to assess and reduce bias in climate models, and to blend simulations with observational data.

**Uncertainty Quantification and Generative Modeling**  
I design conformal and adaptive uncertainty methods for high-dimensional climate fields, and connect these tools with generative flow models for efficient scenario simulation.

**Structure Discovery in Climate Systems**  
I build statistical and machine learning methods to uncover dependence patterns, causal structure, and compound risk in large-scale environmental systems.
