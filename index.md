My research develops rigorous and scalable statistical and machine learning methods for modeling complex spatiotemporal systems, with a primary focus on climate science.

## Research Areas

**Climate Model Evaluation and Integration**
My group develops statistical and machine learning methods for evaluating climate models against observational data. We primarily focus on comparing the long run distributions generated from climate model runs against historically observed climate distributions. We also develop methods for blending climate models with observational data products to constrain future projections. These include neural operator and gaussian process regression based approaches. 

**Uncertainty Quantification and Generative Modeling**
My recent work introduced new conformal prediction methods for climate ensembles and, more generally, for deep operator models. Ongoing work is connecting conformal prediction with generative model to represent conformal predictive distributions. We are also exploring generative modeling, such as conditional flow matching, as an alternative to autoregressive neural climate emulators.

**Structure Discovery in Climate Systems**  
I have also developed statistical and machine learning methods to uncover dependence patterns, causal structure, and compound risk in large-scale climate systems.
