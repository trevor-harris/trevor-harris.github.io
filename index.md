Assistant Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning

I work at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and climate science, with a focus on uncertainty quantification, operator learning, generative modeling. My research develops rigorous and scalable statistical and machine learning methods for modeling complex spatiotemporal systems, with a primary focus on climate science. I study how to align large-scale physical climate models with observational data, quantify uncertainty in high-dimensional forecasts, and design principled tools for understanding climate risk.

## Key Research Areas

**Climate Model Evaluation and Integration**
Two fundamental problems my research tries to address are: 1. How well do climate models align with reality? and 2. How can we better align models with observations without overly constraining them? 

**Uncertainty Quantification and Generative Modeling**
Projecting how the climate will respond to changes (e.g. increasing CO$_2$) is an inherently uncertain task. To inform policy and planning, climate projections must not only forecast future states but also rigorously quantify and convey their uncertainty, especially as the climate system moves into regimes beyond the instrumental record. One key approach I employ is conformal prediction, a flexible statistical framework that generates rigorous uncertainty bounds for black-box forecasters. My recent work introduced new conformal prediction methods for climate ensembles and, more generally, for deep operator models. Ongoing work is connecting conformal prediction with generative model to represent conformal predictive distributions. We are also exploring generative modeling, such as conditional flow matching, as an alternative to autoregressive neural climate emulators.

**Structure Discovery in Climate Systems**  
I have also developed statistical and machine learning methods to uncover dependence patterns, causal structure, and compound risk in large-scale climate systems.
