I am a 4th-year Statistics PhD Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

My research interests broadly include spatiotemporal modeling, functional data analysis, anomaly detection, and Bayesian deep learning. Much of my work is driven by problems in Climatology and Environmental Science. Current projects apply deep generative models to climate model output and study their uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Currently I serve as president of the Statistics Student Seminar Committee, a biweekly seminar series run by Statistics PhD students at UIUC.  

Previously I worked in Insurance building risk assessment models and developing packages for statistical analysis.
