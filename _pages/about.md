About me
======
Trevor Harris is a 4th year Statistics PhD Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Chamapaign. 

My research interests broadly include spatiotemporal modeling, functional data analysis, anomaly detection, and Bayesian deep learning. Much of my work is driven by problems in climatology and paleoclimatology. 

Previously I worked in Insurance building risk assessment models and developing packages for statistical analysis.
