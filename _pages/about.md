Trevor Harris is a 4th-year Statistics PhD Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 

My research interests broadly include spatiotemporal modeling, functional data analysis, anomaly detection, and Bayesian deep learning. Much of my work is driven by problems in climatology and paleoclimatology. For my dissertation, I developed a non-parametric and robust statistic for testing if two functional distributions are equivalent and a new data depth measure for the shapes of continuous functions on Riemannian manifolds. The final project of my dissertation is a fast and robust functional change point detection algorithm for finding multiple mean and covariance changes in a functional time series. I am also concurrently working on Bayesian deep learning approaches for climate model intercomparisons and forecasting.

Currently, I am the president of the Statistics Student Seminar Committee, a biweekly seminar series run by Statistics PhD students at UIUC.  

Previously I worked in Insurance building risk assessment models and developing packages for statistical analysis.
