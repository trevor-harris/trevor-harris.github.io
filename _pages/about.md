I am an Assistant Professor in the Statistics Deparment at Texas A&M University.

My research interests broadly include spatiotemporal modeling, functional data analysis, anomaly detection, and Bayesian deep learning. Much of my work is driven by problems in Climatology, Environmental Science, and Public Health. Current projects apply Deep Learning to data fusion problems, develop uncertainty techniques for deep models, and model vector borne diseases.
