We introduced a robust, data depth based statistic to quantify the difference between two spatiotemporal processes. We used this statistic to show that increasing the amount of proxies input into a DA algorithm generally causes the prior and posterior states to become more distinct. However, there are cases (the arctic) where there is actually information loss from increasing the number of proxies.
